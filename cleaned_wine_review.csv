"I would give one more star if it came clean on the bottle and called itself a 'sweet red'. Instead it get's poetic and grandiose about itself when all it is is a blend which (standard practice) gets a dash of grape juice concentrate to sweeten it.

Its brisk and bright, with inviting citrus, melon and passion fruit aromas leading to mouthwatering grapefruit and zesty lime flavors with hints of minerality on the palate.

"This is a great buy for the price. Someone had given me a bottle and I liked the look of it so much that I didn't want to open it. Had no idea it was so nicely priced and so easily available. Finally opened it when I was in a bind, needing white wine for a favorite holiday recipe and this was all I had on hand. It's a nice, smooth Pinot, very nice flavor, pleasurable to the palate. What I especially love about this brand, however, is the bottle itself! Screw off the black top and there is a smaller neck with a cork closure. The beauty is that the black cap is designed so that it will reseal the bottle without the cork needing to be squeezed back in...a really thoughtful design. I almost hate to admit how much I was impressed by it! Will be stopping by Target specifically to buy more to have in the house. Highly recommend.",great buy price someone given bottle liked look much didnt want open idea nicely priced easily available finally opened bind needing white wine favorite holiday recipe hand nice smooth pinot very nice flavor pleasurable palate especially love brand however bottle screw black top smaller neck cork closure beauty black cap designed reseal bottle without cork needing squeezed back ina really thoughtful design almost hate admit much impressed stopping target specifically buy house highly recommend,5.0

Wine is a personal thing but for me it is my 1 pick in the under 10 category. It is well balanced, subtle, and very easy to sip. Dry without being overpowering.

"I really like this tea and have bought it many times. The blend called Chinese Restaurant Tea is a blend of green, oolong and jasmine. It doesn't contain ginseng or black tea, which might explain why some people don't like it. (Black tea is more common and smoother tasting than green, which can be grassy or sharp tasting.) It does taste like the teas I have had at better Asian restaurants. (Some of the cheapo ones don't even serve tea any more.)I like the packaging and the name. Kind of quirky, stripped down and charming to my mind. It is hard for me to find this tea in stores. I called the company and they said it was only available in certain regions.

It was much cheaper in the store than it is on-line but I am just glad to have found it!

I don't even add any sugar or honey to it, the taste is that good. My only complaint is that the box claims it is 100 natural, but I wish they would disclose the amount and type of Ginseng. I bought this tea because of the Ginseng, so it would be nice if they disclosed what type of Ginseng and what concentration of it is in the tea itself. Since this is a pretty inexpensive tea, I'm guessing it's a cheap low-quality Ginseng, but like I said, it is tasty. Another nice benefit of this tea is that you can just drop the tea bag into a glass of room temperature water and drink it that way, it's very tasty this way! You don't have to steep or brew it with hot water, so it makes it a nice drinkable tea year round.",really like taste tea especially cold green tea mixed ginseng theyve added licorice root perhaps sweeten tea dont even add sugar honey taste good complaint box claim natural wish would disclose amount type ginseng bought tea ginseng would nice disclosed type ginseng concentration tea since pretty inexpensive tea im guessing cheap lowquality ginseng like said tasty another nice benefit tea drop tea bag glass room temperature water drink way very tasty way dont steep brew hot water make nice drinkable tea year round,0.0

"This little 3-pack assortment is a great way to try all three flavors of Bali's Best Tea Candy. Previously, I had purchased a single pack of the Citrus Green Tea, from a specialty shop. It was so incredible... I wish I had bought about 10 packs of it.Upon reading reviews, I thought the Classic Iced Tea might be to my liking as well. I am not a big fan of green tea latte, but thought that I should give it a try, since other people raved about it so much. I was right. The Green Tea Latte was my least favorite of the three. It reminded me a little of green tea ice cream. Okay once in a while, but not an every day treat for me. I prefer the crisp/clear taste, over the creamy/milky flavor. Just personal preference.Now, I simply cannot decide which of the other 2 flavors I love more. They are so incredible tasting, and smooth textured. I love both the astringency and the acidity.

"3 stars only because this really tasty No Calorie margarita mix cast me 17 FOR ONE BOTTLE!I'm a margarita fan and also trying to lose some weight. There aren't many really good lime mixers out there in the Low to NO Calorie category, so when I discovered SCALES on the shelf while visiting in Scottsdale AZ (for a reasonable 6.99 bottle), I was delighted to discover how tangy limey good it tastes- just right for excellent margaritas, but cutting about 100-150 calories out of your cocktail!I was dismayed when I returned home (though not exactly surprised) to find that Scales was not available in Washington state. So when I looked for it on Amazon and saw its other flavors offered on prime for 7.99 and the Margarita was offered at 17, I thought this must be for two or three bottles.

"I received a case of Goslings diet ginger beer today. I had such high hopes for this product because this would be this first reasonably priced diet ginger beer that I could ship to my home that I have actually heard of (I had previously bought a case of Royalty diet ginger beer at Amazon, but I had never heard of the brand before buying it). I knew Goslings has a good reputation among Ginger Beers, so I had an expectation that I might have found a better diet ginger beer. Sadly, I was mistakenI tried this product in three blind taste tests with Royalty diet ginger beer as my alternative. In each of the three tests, I had a strong preference for Royalty. I found Goslings diet ginger beer to be overly sweet and syrupy, lacking in strong ginger flavor, and completely devoid of that spicy ginger bite that true ginger beer fans expect. Goslings diet ginger beer also has an unpleasant aftertaste that serves as a fitting exclamation point to this products mediocrity.I have had worse ginger beers. Saranac and Reeds come to mind. That said, Goslings diet ginger beer is simply an inferior product. When the price of this soda is similar to the diet ginger beers from Royalty or Barritts (for those who are lucky enough to have access to it), there is simply no reason to purchase Goslings diet ginger beer.Please note: I have used this product as a diet ginger beer, which I consumed plain or over ice. Although I highly doubt it, Goslings diet ginger beer may be the superior product for use in Dark n Stormy or Moscow Mule cocktails.",received case gosling diet ginger beer today high hope product would first reasonably priced diet ginger beer could ship home actually heard previously bought case royalty diet ginger beer amazon never heard brand buying knew gosling good reputation among ginger beer expectation might found better diet ginger beer sadly mistakeni tried product three blind taste test royalty diet ginger beer alternative three test strong preference royalty found gosling diet ginger beer overly sweet syrupy lacking strong ginger flavor completely devoid spicy ginger bite true ginger beer fan expect gosling diet ginger beer also unpleasant aftertaste serf fitting exclamation point product mediocrityi worse ginger beer saranac reed come mind said gosling diet ginger beer simply inferior product price soda similar diet ginger beer royalty barritts lucky enough access simply reason purchase gosling diet ginger beerplease note used product diet ginger beer consumed plain ice although highly doubt gosling diet ginger beer may superior product use dark n stormy moscow mule cocktail,0.0

"I reached out in the comments to ask another member how this turned out, but to no avail. Despite my reservations, I ordered the kit and in a few days a USPS box arrived at my house. I opened the box and found that there was no fluff, no boxed kit, there were just ingredients (partial mash) and instructions. The 6 pound pouch of DME and other pouches had handwritten on it what it was and when to use them. Admittedly I wrinkled my nose and thought what the hell is this. Brew day came and went and I had no problems with making the wort, everything went smooth. Eight days go by and I find that the FG reading on the batch is where I want it to be so I bottled 51 bottles of beer to condition.Fast forward 7 days now. I opened one to test it out. This beer turned out really good. The dark red color of the batch hails to it being a true Irish Red. The beer has a slightly malty flavor with subtle hints of caramel notes to it. It's not overly hoppy (which I detest in beers). I'd purchase this again in a heartbeat.As a note to other people who may buy this, I enjoy darker, stouter beers. This might have better results if you thin the wort out by adding an extra 1/2 gallon or so of water. My beer came out darker than what is pictured (see below), some people strive for that true red coloring, and while this turned out red, it is a bit darker than traditional Irish Red's.",reached comment ask another member turned avail despite reservation ordered kit day usps box arrived house opened box found fluff boxed kit ingredient partial mash instruction pound pouch dme pouch handwritten use admittedly wrinkled nose thought hell brew day came went problem making wort everything went smooth eight day go find fg reading batch want bottled bottle beer conditionfast forward day opened one test beer turned really good dark red color batch hail true irish red beer slightly malty flavor subtle hint caramel note overly hoppy detest beer id purchase heartbeatas note people may buy enjoy darker stouter beer might better result thin wort adding extra gallon water beer came darker pictured see people strive true red coloring turned red bit darker traditional irish red,0.0

"This really is the best root beer I have ever tasted! I usually buy it in our grocery store (about 4.50 per four pack), but it's sold out a lot! The ingredients are clean and natural, while most of the other root beers have junk ingredients, caramel color.

"Virgils Natural Micro Brewed Rootbeer Soda, 12 Ounce -- 24 per case, from Virgils Rootbeer.I have mixed feelings about Virgil's Rootbeer. To start with, the root and bark of the Sassafras tree are no longer used, as they cause cancer and liver damage. The Sarsaparilla vine used to be used, but nowadays, most root beers use an artificial sarsaparilla flavor. Virgil's is naturally brewed from Sweet Birch, and a lot of other natural flavors. The licorice does not improve it, it contains too much sugar, and it is packaged in a breakable glass bottle. Processed food makers in general use far too much sugar and salt than is good for us. Virgil's RootBeer is natural and definitely different, but as a root beer, I can only give it three and a half Amazon stars, rounded off to four stars, as Amazon requires ratings to be in whole numbers.The Nutrition Facts, and Ingredients, as listed on the bottle:Nutrition Facts:Serving size: 12 oz.

"My wife and I just performed a taste test of three different tonic waters. We used Bombay Gin in all three to keep the variables to one--the tonic water. We used Schweppes Tonic Water, Q Tonic Water, and Fever-Tree Tonic Water. We thought the Fever-Tree was the best, with Q Tonic second, and Schweppes Tonic a distant third. The Schweppes had a cloying off-taste compared to the other two which we attributed to the high fructose corn syrup which sweetens it. Before we purchased the two premium tonic waters, we thought Schweppes was the best compared to Canada Dry and Seagram's. But the two premium tonic waters were both better. The Q Tonic (sweetened with agave nectar) was less sweet (and lower in calories) than the Fever-Tree (sweetened with cane sugar) and had a distinctly different taste, more subdued compared to Fever-Tree. Both had clean and crisp finishes that were very refreshing. We both thought Fever-Tree had more flavor, especially more citrus flavor, and we preferred it. We will be happy to finish the rest of the case of Q Tonic we bought, but we are going to purchase only Fever-Tree in the future. We prefer gin and tonics with Bombay Sapphire and Tanqueray Gins. We tried Fever-Tree with Hendrick's Gin and it was good, better than Hendrick's in martinis, with which we prefer Bombay Sapphire.",wife performed taste test three different tonic water used bombay gin three keep variable onethe tonic water used schweppes tonic water q tonic water fevertree tonic water thought fevertree best q tonic second schweppes tonic distant third schweppes cloying offtaste compared two attributed high fructose corn syrup sweetens purchased two premium tonic water thought schweppes best compared canada dry seagrams two premium tonic water better q tonic sweetened agave nectar le sweet lower calorie fevertree sweetened cane sugar distinctly different taste subdued compared fevertree clean crisp finish very refreshing thought fevertree flavor especially citrus flavor preferred happy finish rest case q tonic bought going purchase fevertree future prefer gin tonic bombay sapphire tanqueray gin tried fevertree hendricks gin good better hendricks martini prefer bombay sapphire,0.0

My husband prefers G and T's, and he said it has changed the way he views tonic water. What started out as a search for a healthier alternative has actually ended up changing the way we see mixers. I love this tonic water and will be ordering more. With the free shipping, it's actually not much more expensive than Schweppes, especially when you consider that Schweppes goes flat so quickly in the huge liter bottle.

"Man oh man, I love Fever Tree's Ginger Beer. I asked for a ginger ale at the St. Regis in San Francisco and got this instead. What a pleasant surprise! The smell of ginger transformed me to another world. A world of sakura petals falling softly on verdant, rolling hills with a warm breeze and snow capped mountains in the background. I took a sip and little pebbles of joy started dancing in my mouth. And the fun didn't just go away like with your average drink. The taste lingers, prolonging the experience. This is a drink for parties, after-parties and after-after-parties. Or to be enjoyed alone.There's a scripture that describes my reaction to this drink. And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with exceedingly great joy wherefore, I began to be desirous that my family should partake of it also for I knew that it was desirable above all other fruit. (1 Nephi 8:12)If you like it, you'll know you are in select company. I gave two bottles to my next door neighbor. They returned one unopened. A friend said it cleared her sinuses, but did little else for her. My wife rolled her eyes the same way she does when I burn incense. Fine. All the more for me.After returning from San Francisco, I started my search. For six months I searched. Whole Foods doesn't have it. Trader Joe's doesn't have it.

"These were once the best Ginger Beers in the world. Nothing else even came close. I had been buying these by the case for years from Amazon (sometimes as many as 1-3 cases per month)! They were not only the most mouth watering concoction I had ever tasted in my life (and I know my Ginger Beers), but they helped me so much in quelling the nausea I am dealing with from doing chemo, as there was so much fresh Ginger in them (almost medicinal for me). A tonic that I could never let myself run out of. Thanks to Amazon Prime, I never did run out, and all was well for a very long time.Everything changed in October 2013 when I received three cases of this once wonderful Ginger Beer.

"Man oh man, I love Fever Tree's Ginger Beer. I asked for a ginger ale at the St. Regis in San Francisco and got this instead. What a pleasant surprise! The smell of ginger transformed me to another world. A world of sakura petals falling softly on verdant, rolling hills with a warm breeze and snow capped mountains in the background. I took a sip and little pebbles of joy started dancing in my mouth. And the fun didn't just go away like with your average drink. The taste lingers, prolonging the experience. This is a drink for parties, after-parties and after-after-parties. Or to be enjoyed alone.There's a scripture that describes my reaction to this drink. And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with exceedingly great joy wherefore, I began to be desirous that my family should partake of it also for I knew that it was desirable above all other fruit. (1 Nephi 8:12)If you like it, you'll know you are in select company. I gave two bottles to my next door neighbor. They returned one unopened. A friend said it cleared her sinuses, but did little else for her. My wife rolled her eyes the same way she does when I burn incense. Fine. All the more for me.After returning from San Francisco, I started my search. For six months I searched. Whole Foods doesn't have it. Trader Joe's doesn't have it. Your local grocery store will almost certainly not have it. But Amazon has it. And now so can you!

"My wife and I just performed a taste test of three different tonic waters. We used Bombay Gin in all three to keep the variables to one--the tonic water. We used Schweppes Tonic Water, Q Tonic Water, and Fever-Tree Tonic Water. We thought the Fever-Tree was the best, with Q Tonic second, and Schweppes Tonic a distant third. The Schweppes had a cloying off-taste compared to the other two which we attributed to the high fructose corn syrup which sweetens it. Before we purchased the two premium tonic waters, we thought Schweppes was the best compared to Canada Dry and Seagram's. But the two premium tonic waters were both better. The Q Tonic (sweetened with agave nectar) was less sweet (and lower in calories) than the Fever-Tree (sweetened with cane sugar) and had a distinctly different taste, more subdued compared to Fever-Tree. Both had clean and crisp finishes that were very refreshing. We both thought Fever-Tree had more flavor, especially more citrus flavor, and we preferred it. We will be happy to finish the rest of the case of Q Tonic we bought, but we are going to purchase only Fever-Tree in the future. We prefer gin and tonics with Bombay Sapphire and Tanqueray Gins. We tried Fever-Tree with Hendrick's Gin and it was good, better than Hendrick's in martinis, with which we prefer Bombay Sapphire.",wife performed taste test three different tonic water used bombay gin three keep variable onethe tonic water used schweppes tonic water q tonic water fevertree tonic water thought fevertree best q tonic second schweppes tonic distant third schweppes cloying offtaste compared two attributed high fructose corn syrup sweetens purchased two premium tonic water thought schweppes best compared canada dry seagrams two premium tonic water better q tonic sweetened agave nectar le sweet lower calorie fevertree sweetened cane sugar distinctly different taste subdued compared fevertree clean crisp finish very refreshing thought fevertree flavor especially citrus flavor preferred happy finish rest case q tonic bought going purchase fevertree future prefer gin tonic bombay sapphire tanqueray gin tried fevertree hendricks gin good better hendricks martini prefer bombay sapphire,0.0

"Do you love margaritas They are among the most popular adult beverages in America and many people rank them as their favorite alcoholic beverage of all. The right tequila can make a noticeable difference when mixing up a margarita, but the right mixer is important as well. And one of the best mixers available is Power Mahoney Margarita.I just got to know Powell Mahoney recently and I have been singing its praises ever since. This mix is every bit as delicious as the others in the Powell Mahoney lineup thanks in no small part to the all- natural ingredients used in the process. Have you taken a good look at the ingredients used in other mixers They're enough to make even the most tolerant person cringe. Even a really good tequila often cannot mask the taste of a bad mixer and I can think of many mixed drinks that I could barely finish due to a less-than-pleasant mixer base.With Powell Mahnoey Margarita mixer, you get the great, natural taste you desire with a good balance between the sweet and the sour. Pour a little into a glass and taste it all by itself. You will notice flavors of lime and a little bit of orange with an overall taste that leans toward the sour side but one that seems just right to match with a fine tequila. The taste is even good enough that some people might enjoy this mixer served with non- alcoholic combinations like soda water and even on the rocks with nothing added.Margaritas are popular drinks but even your favorite drink can lose its appeal if it contains a weak ingredient. With Powell Mahoney Margarita mixer, you get the great, natural, fresh citrus flavor that makes for the perfect mixed drink.

This comes on strong with the central flavor and enticing bitterness, but lacks the secondary and tertiary notes that make a flavor memorable. So, it's good. If I didn't make my own, very good - it would be a regular on my shelf. Recommended, unless you make your own.-- wiredweirdPS: I'm not a fan of dropper bottles, and this comes with a medicine dropper.

I bought 2 dozen of the various types -- flaky butter, reduced fat, and standard -- and all had the same problems to some degree. Although I was using the rolls up to 3 weeks prior to the 30JUN13 expiration date on the end-cap of the packages, the dough in many packages was so dry (old poorly stored) that it would stick to the packaging. And it was impossible to unroll the dough.. I had to pry off chunks ... and then try to put the chunks together like a jigsaw puzzle into some Frankenrolls. The other reviews say the SAME THING ... going back as far as 2009. And now I'm extending that same complaint to mid-2013.

The dough that was salvageable, in no way resembled a crescent. I had to form it into triangles by myself, of course the dough was so sticky that it was nearly impossible.

As always, I tasted the wine to establish dryness and flavor at the 4 week mark. From my experience, I believe this will be one of my better Merlots. The oak added the dryness I was looking for, the elderberries gave it a nice fruity flavor and the base Merlot had a nice all around wine flavor.

"I recently have begun enjoying margaritas. I havent done a lot of searching for different mix and am pretty sure that this one is a good bet. I like my margaritas on the rocks and this mix seems to really do the trick as far as flavor. The reason I had even picked up a bottle to try is because the local golf course uses this to mix their margaritas and so I thought it would be a good start for me. I didnt have to search long to find it and I actually paid a decent price for it. The container is easy to pour out of and is sturdy. I use Jose Cuervo to mix my margaritas, although I think any tequila would work. I dont shake mine yet because I still need to buy a shaker but I do give them a good mix. The overall taste of the mix is sweet and tart, but not overly powerful on those to senses. I recently mowed my lawn and had a cocktail as I did so, and the mix was just the right flavor to enjoy a nice summer day. I will definitely be purchasing more of this mix in the near future and maybe adding different fruit flavors to it to punch it up a notch, but dont get me wrong the flavor out of the bottle is very good.",recently begun enjoying margarita havent done lot searching different mix pretty sure one good bet like margarita rock mix seems really trick far flavor reason even picked bottle try local golf course us mix margarita thought would good start didnt search long find actually paid decent price container easy pour sturdy use jose cuervo mix margarita although think tequila would work dont shake mine yet still need buy shaker give good mix overall taste mix sweet tart overly powerful sens recently mowed lawn cocktail mix right flavor enjoy nice summer day definitely purchasing mix near future maybe adding different fruit flavor punch notch dont get wrong flavor bottle very good,5.0

"We received the unit a few days ago. So far it is as promised. Noise level outside the unit is acceptable--slightly less than your average refrigerator, around 40db in the surrounding area. Fine for a common area of the home. It cooled our wine down from 77 to 55 degrees pretty quickly. We have tried out a couple of thermo-electric units that seems to run for hours upon hours, never quite reaching the desired temperature--so we decided to go with a compressor based refrigerator that has more power and therefore, won't have to run as many hours (and require service/repair as quickly). The cooler looks great as shown. The refrigerant is R600--it is nontoxic--which is a big plus. When it is running, the top of the unit gets hot--so don't put any candles on it! We removed the second-to-last shelf (towards the bottom) to comfortably accommodate our different-sized bottles. We currently have 30 bottles in there, and could fit comfortably 5-7 more (Syrah, Grenache and Burgundy bottles take up more space than standard Bordeaux-type bottles). It is hard to find a good quality, long-lasting wine refrigerator--after much research--hopefully we have found the best one. Time will tell. Finally, I would give five stars for this cooler, however the seller was extremely slow to respond to my product inquiries and is unclear as to the terms of warranty (other companies have stated one year for cooler plus 3 years for compressor, for instance). Hopefully we won't have any problems in the future, in which case I suppose we would have to lean on Amazon to remedy the situation.",received unit day ago far promised noise level outside unit acceptableslightly le average refrigerator around db surrounding area fine common area home cooled wine degree pretty quickly tried couple thermoelectric unit seems run hour upon hour never quite reaching desired temperatureso decided go compressor based refrigerator power therefore wont run many hour require servicerepair quickly cooler look great shown refrigerant rit nontoxicwhich big plus running top unit get hotso dont put candle removed secondtolast shelf towards bottom comfortably accommodate differentsized bottle currently bottle could fit comfortably syrah grenache burgundy bottle take space standard bordeauxtype bottle hard find good quality longlasting wine refrigeratorafter much researchhopefully found best one time tell finally would give five star cooler however seller extremely slow respond product inquiry unclear term warranty company stated one year cooler plus year compressor instance hopefully wont problem future case suppose would lean amazon remedy situation,0.0

"I was searching for coconut syrup at my Walmart one day, and I found this Coco Real in the mixed drinks section. While I don't drink alcoholic drinks, I do enjoy mocktails occasionally, so I figured if it wouldn't work for pancakes, then I could make Pina/Colada Mocktails out of it and some pineapple juice. I shook the bottle good to make sure everything was mixed well, then used it on my hot pancakes at home. It was sooooo good. I usually only use pure maple syrup on them, but wanted some coconut syrup. This really filled that need so well. It was so delicious that I do believe I wouldn't even need to use butter on my pancakes when I use Coco Real as my syrup. It's not been easy to find locally for some reason, not even at the Walmart where I found it once. I bought the last two bottles Walmart had that day. It would be very nice if Walmart.com would make it available by the bottle without having to purchase an entire case at one time. I used one of those two bottles up pretty fast, but since I can't find it anymore, I am saving my remaining bottle for when I will get a real bad craving for coconut syrup. Torani also makes a good sugar-free coconut syrup that I would like for Walmart.com to keep in stock regularly, as well as their sugar-free Watermelon syrup. In the hot summertime, Torani sugar-free Watermelon syrup makes such refreshing drinks, and it goes well with Mexican food, which I really enjoy.

"I developed an appreciation for this drink during my days of frequent airline travel. I prefer to drink them straight (without booze). As a result, I started buying bottles of the mix at the grocery store--because finding this by the can in the real world is impossible. IMPOSSIBLE. Unfortunately, when you buy this by the bottle something happens. The first glass tastes exactly as you expected. But once you open the bottle, if you don't drink the contents within 24-36 hours the taste turns. Keeping a stock of cans in the house, therefore, is essential.

"Bitters are making a resurgence these days and I know many bars (at least here in NYC) are bringing back a properly made cocktail. Looking at old cocktail books from the 20s, 30s, and 40s I found that bitters were a key ingredient in many classic cocktails. After doing extensive research I learned that Regan's made some of the best, if not the best, orange bitters (go to their website and read the story behind this product). Your other choices are Fee Brothers and Angostura. Regan's however gets, and in my opinion, deserves top billing when it comes to orange bitters. These bitters are great in a variety of drinks and I usually put two dashes in my Old Raj martinis. Although you don't get a strong orange flavor per se you do notice that these bitters subtly enhance the complexity of the drink. Try these and you won't be disappointed. Go to Regan's website to find literally hundreds of drink recipes that use their bitters.

"I have been working my way back to classic cocktail recipes ever since reading David Wondrich's book Imbibe! on the great Professor Jerry Thomas and his cocktail recipes and techniques. A wealth of information there and a beginning of a long journey to try to recreate the cocktail prior to the great disaster called Prohibition. As a martini drinker, I naturally wanted to explore the tastes of the original drink so I began with orange bitters. In my market there were no retailers who carried orange bitters, so I had to rely on the ever more expensive places that will ship the stuff to your door. I started with Fee Brothers orange bitters and then tried the Peychaud version of Gary Regan's orange bitters (no. 6). Finally about 3 months ago a local liquor and wine store chain started stocking the new Angostura orange bitters. Thinking it would be easier and less expensive to support a local merchant and also wanting to try the bitters, I picked up a bottle. I was a little taken aback when I saw the retail price, 11 versus 7 for Fee Brothers and 6 for Regan's. I decided to try it anyway.Upon opening the bottle I realized that the bottle itself was orange colored and the internal contents were virtually colorless. Having made many fruit and peel extractions for liqueurs, I was very suspicious. Forging on I sniffed the aroma from the open bottle. The first smell is definitely orange, with an underlying clove aroma and something cloying behind those aromas that does not seem to work well. In the drink the orange flavor is good and the bitterness that is necessary in a quality bitter is apparent. But it seems to me that it is quickly overwhelmed by something like a passion fruit flavor that definitely does not belong in a martini. I would consider using this product in drinks that have some fruit juice and will experiment some with it. I think wit would compliment a splash of pineapple juice in a drink like the Cobalt, but I would not use it in a martini.",working way back classic cocktail recipe ever since reading david wondrichs book imbibe great professor jerry thomas cocktail recipe technique wealth information beginning long journey try recreate cocktail prior great disaster called prohibition martini drinker naturally wanted explore taste original drink began orange bitter market retailer carried orange bitter rely ever expensive place ship stuff door started fee brother orange bitter tried peychaud version gary regans orange bitter finally month ago local liquor wine store chain started stocking new angostura orange bitter thinking would easier le expensive support local merchant also wanting try bitter picked bottle little taken aback saw retail price versus fee brother regans decided try anywayupon opening bottle realized bottle orange colored internal content virtually colorless made many fruit peel extraction liqueur very suspicious forging sniffed aroma open bottle first smell definitely orange underlying clove aroma something cloying behind aroma seem work well drink orange flavor good bitterness necessary quality bitter apparent seems quickly overwhelmed something like passion fruit flavor definitely belong martini would consider using product drink fruit juice experiment think wit would compliment splash pineapple juice drink like cobalt would use martini,0.0

In fact, I may have been converted to orange. I find it versatile in that its great for cocktails, non-alcoholic mixers, and flavoring carbonated water such as club soda and seltzer.

"Angostura Orange Bitters is now the third product in a tiny little product niche that includes long-standing stalwart Fee Brother's and Regan's No. 6.

"This mustard came as a Christmas stocking stuffer. I've tried various spicy mustards over the years in hope I would find the perfect mustard. Some have been really good, some not quite so good. And to some extent what I want depends on what sort of mood I'm in and what I'm putting the mustard on. I have come to really like this Alstertor mustard. It has a pleasant taste without being overwhelming. Although I consider it a fairly mild mustard, it is stronger (and nicer) than a typical dijon mustard. At the same time it doesn't have the astringency of certain mustards that heavily emphasize the horseradish. I have found it to be a great complement to large soft pretzels. It also works pretty well with a not overly spiced sausage as well. And I like the little mug.

"I purchased this mustard based on the reviews. I am not disappointed in the taste however, I am in the packaging and the price.

I have found it at MyBrands, which is the importer's site for public sale, at 2.25 and elsewhere for 3 and up. I think the 8.49 price has the free shipping built in.

"I have been using Carmex in it's familiar pot since high school. I remember it like yesterday. The girls gathered in the ladies room between classes to gossip, giggle, brush our hair and put on Carmex to soften our lips. We had to be ready just in case the cute boy we crushed on spoke to us. We wouldn't be kissing in class, but, we followed the ritual so our lips would be perfect.

"My lips are almost ALWAYS chapped without Carmex. I've had dry and chapped lips for so long and I've tried everything: Blistex, EOS, Chapsticks, Lucas' PawPaw and even medicated lip ointments. I recently picked up a Carmex over an 'instinctual urge' and I don't think I've ever looked back since. Carmex does wonders for my lips. They're so smooth and soft now - even my boyfriend has commented on them! The consistency is just right, not too thin and not too thick. I've found with Lucas' Pawpaw, it's only good for chapped lips and Blistex and EOS only gives me a thin layer of lip balm. I like to apply lip balm before I sleep because my room sits at a cool 11 degrees celsius. I find that because of the consistency, Carmex really absorbs and heals your lips while you sleep. Blistex leaves a thin coating on my lips when I wake up whilst pawpaw doesn't absorb very well either and sometimes dries out my lips even more. I recommend this little tub of goodness to everyone and anyone who is looking for a great lip balm or lip remedy. I've only needed to apply it 3-4 times daily, and I have extremely dry and chapped lips from my medication and it works wonders for me.

"I started using carmex when I moved back home to Chicago in 1979. A co-worker at the Hospital turned me onto Carmex. She told me it was a staple for Winters in Chicago. I have used it ever since and I live in the Southeast now. It's not just good for sore chapped winter lips it's perfect for surfing, a lipstick base or gloss, or just dry lips.

There is always at least 1 in the laundry room (freshly laundered) 2-3 in his desk drawer and a couple of brand new ones, just in case.

"I bought 2 of the wine collections; one in the mixed of white & red and one in the all reds. The only one we thought was somewhat decent was the Chardonnay. The funny thing is, we aren't even Chardonnay drinkers! We both thought that one was the only consumable wine. Still bad but the best of the whole lot of wines. Rose was the next best but very tart, pulling slightly sour and not in a good way. Both the Pinot & Cab Sauv were very sour, almost like corked wine tastes. It burned when you drank it, like you were drinking straight rubbing alcohol. Gross! We brought them to the correct temp, let them breathe, etc... but they are just straight up nasty. Was a big disappointment as we were really looking forward to getting them and being on auto-delivery. I'm giving 2 stars since the packaging of wine in the boxes & the shipping was great as well as QVC customer service. I called & explained everything to QVC and immediately received a refund!!

"I purchased two of these as holiday gifts. The price seemed just right for a bottle of wine, glasses and chocolate. In fact, even without glasses, this would've been a good value to ship across country. I was skeptical about how nicely the presentation would look in person but the recipients sent a picture and I was floored. It looks gorgeous. And expensive. I can't speak to the quality of the wine, but as far as the overall gift, I am pleased that the recipients are pleased and would purchase again. However, as another reviewer noted and that I did not read before purchasing, there was some risqu little cards included in the gift box that boldly stated let's get naked referring I'm sure to the name of the winery.

"I'm really picky about wine. To be honest, I've had cheap wine that is good and more expensive wine that is not good. A good wine to me has a good balance.

I didn't care for the chardonnay, but my husband said it was ""ok."" I'd like to get the 3 bottle pack that you can choose, but the current price makes the 3 bottle pack more expensive per bottle. I'd say all in all, this is a decent middle of the road group of wines. The moscato impressed me the most. For those who haven't heard of the bartenura comparison, it's a $11-16 bottle, so it puts it right in about the same class as O'Leary. If you're curious about this, if say take a chance.
